The DELICIOUS creamy sauce permeates every single bite of this dish! Creamy chicken pasta with spinach and bacon is one of my favorite things to eat! Instead, this pasta sauce is just four ingredients: onion, garlic, a can of crushed tomatoes, and cream. That last ingredient is what makes the sauce extra special, but it&#39;s not poured with a heavy hand.

This chicken pasta has a light creamy tomato Alfredo sauce. It is ridiculously good minus all the heaviness of traditional creamy Alfredo. This creamy chicken pasta bake is one that I have been making since I was in university. The tomato cream sauce is easier on the waistline, but still has a rich and creamy taste. If you don&#39;t want it spicy, omit the cayenne and chilli powder and use some black pepper to taste instead.
