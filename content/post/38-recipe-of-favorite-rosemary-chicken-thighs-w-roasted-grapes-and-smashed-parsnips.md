Whole roast chicken, stuffed with grapes and seasoned with rosemary, thyme, onions, and lemon. One of the first things I ever learned to cook on my own (post college quesadillas) was roast chicken. Roast chicken is actually crazy easy, given that all you really need. The flavours of fragrant rosemary and fruity grapes make this roast chicken recipe (using kosher meat and wine) a great roast Once done, the chicken should be crisp and golden on the outside and the juice should run clear from the thigh. Serve the chicken with the sticky, sweet grapes and jus.
